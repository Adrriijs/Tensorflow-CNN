# 🚀 Image Classification Using CNNs with TensorFlow

## 📌 Overview  
This project builds an **image classification model** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow**. The model is trained on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which contains 60,000 small color images classified into 10 categories, such as airplanes, cars, cats, and dogs.  

## 🔍 Dataset: CIFAR-10  
CIFAR-10 is a dataset containing **10 classes** of images:  
- **airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck**  
- Each image has a **size of 32x32 pixels** with **3 color channels (RGB).**  

## 📖 Features of this Project  
✅ **Loads and Preprocesses CIFAR-10 Dataset**  
✅ **Builds a CNN Model for Image Classification**  
✅ **Trains and Validates the Model Using TensorFlow & Keras**  
✅ **Evaluates Accuracy and Performance on Test Data**  
✅ **Displays Predictions with Actual Labels**  
✅ **Handles Dynamic Image Count for Testing**
